# Random image selector
Picks a random image from a given directory and displays it on the window. The program was primarily made to generate only one image per day, but I added the option to turn daily generations off. 
**It works well, but due to it being old, the structure of the code is poor. I also do not have plans to continue working on this project anytime soon.**

# Notes:
Upon running the program for the first time, the program will create a folder named 'data' in the same directory the program is in.
